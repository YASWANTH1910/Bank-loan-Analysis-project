# Bank-loan-Analysis-project
**Project Overview**

The project analyzes bank loan data using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL. It focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and actionable recommendations through various KPIs and dashboards.

**Key Insights and Recommendations**

Year-wise Loan Analysis:

Gradual growth in loan amounts from 2007 to 2009, followed by a significant spike in 2010 and 2011.
Recommendation: Analyze repayment performance and delinquency rates for loans issued in 2010-2011 to address risks and support future growth.

Grade-wise Revolving Balances:

High balances are concentrated in Grades A, B, and C (sub-grades A4, A5, B3, B4, B5, and C1).
Recommendation: Offer financial education to lower-grade customers to reduce default risks.

Customer Verification Impact:

Verified customers contribute to 59% of total payments, indicating stability and lower risk.
Recommendation: Encourage customer verification through incentives like reduced interest rates or faster approvals.

Loan Status Trends by State and Month:

Peaks in loan activity at the end of each quarter, especially in December, suggest reporting cycles or seasonal demand.
Recommendation: Optimize loan offerings and plan resources around these spikes.

Home Ownership and Last Payment Trends:

Increased activity in mortgage and rent categories from October to December.
Recommendation: Investigate housing needs in the "Other" category for potential product offerings.

**Challenges Encountered:**

Data inconsistencies and formatting issues (e.g., mismatched date formats and column names).
Duplicate or missing records affecting data accuracy.
Complex merging criteria due to the lack of a single common identifier.

**Dashboards:**

Excel Dashboard: Visualized year-wise loan data, grade performance, and loan status.
Power BI Dashboard: Integrated dynamic visualizations for state-wise and monthly loan performance.
Tableau Dashboard: Provided advanced visuals for revolving balances and payment statuses.

**SQL Utilization:**

Extracted and preprocessed data for analysis, highlighting payment trends and loan disbursement details.

**Risk Management:**

High-balance customers in certain grades pose higher risks, requiring targeted risk mitigation strategies.

**Marketing and Customer Engagement:**

Tailored marketing strategies can boost verification rates and expand the bank’s market presence.

**Strategic Expansion:**

Careful evaluation of new markets is essential to sustain growth without compromising loan quality.

**Operational Efficiency:**

Aligning resources with demand peaks can enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

**Data Quality Improvement:**

Addressing data inconsistencies and duplicates will enhance the reliability of insights.

**Conclusion:**

Insights highlight opportunities for targeted marketing, resource planning, and product diversification to optimize the bank’s loan portfolio and mitigate risks.
